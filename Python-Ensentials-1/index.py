# Python is an interpreted language. This means that it inherits all the described advantages and disadvantages. Of course, it adds some of its unique features to both sets.
# Why Python? it's easy to learn, it's easy to teach,it's easy to use for writing new software, it's easy to understand and it's easy to obtain, install and deploy
# Why not Python? low-level programming (sometimes called "close to metal" programming): if you want to implement an extremely effective driver or graphical engine, you wouldn't use Python and applications for mobile devices: although this territory is still waiting to be conquered by Python, it will most likely happen someday
